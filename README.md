# Objective

   Part of an interview project, no real learnings.

# Notes 

   I chose to use `react-query` to manage data fetching as it provides out of the box caching which impacts the performance a lot.
   I have tried to make the app fast and performant.

   I would have introduced code splitting if the js bundles would have been heavier , it seemed over optimization at this point.
   I would have spent a little more time on the design and UI part, as I have not spent much time on it and it can be better.
